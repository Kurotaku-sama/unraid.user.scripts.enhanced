## Notes

- This plugin enhances but does not replace the original User Scripts functionality. <br>All core functions are only provided by the original plugin.

- If you uninstall the plugin, all configuration and category data will be deleted. <br>
Therefore, it's recommended to back up the config and categories beforehand if you plan to reinstall the plugin later.<br>
You can restore them by placing the backed-up files into
<code>/boot/config/plugins/user.scripts.enhanced</code>.

## Known Issues

- Rapidly refreshing the page multiple times can cause AJAX requests to be aborted or delayed by the browser. This behavior depends on the browser used â€” for example, it occurs in Firefox but typically not in Chromium-based browsers. As a result, slower loading times may occur because the PHP backend is briefly overwhelmed handling these requests. Despite this, the categories and scripts will typically load correctly after a short delay.
